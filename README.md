# Train - Transport Interface

[![Build status](https://badge.buildkite.com/ee9d6f49d995b23e943955b12d5aaadf4314d12b7cc99b03be.svg?branch=master)](https://buildkite.com/chef-oss/inspec-train-master-verify)
[![Gem Version](https://badge.fury.io/rb/train.svg)](https://badge.fury.io/rb/train)



Train lets you talk to your local or remote operating systems and APIs with a unified interface.

It allows you to:

* execute commands via `run_command`
* interact with files via `file`
* identify the target operating system via `os`
* authenticate to API-based services and treat them like a platform

Train supports:

* Local execution
* SSH
* WinRM
* Docker and Podman
* Mock (for testing and debugging)
* AWS as an API
* Azure as an API
* VMware via PowerCLI
* Habitat

# Examples

## Setup

**Local**

```ruby
require 'train'
train = Train.create('local')
```

**SSH**

```ruby
require 'train'
train = Train.create('ssh',
  host: '1.2.3.4', port: 22, user: 'root', key_files: '/vagrant')
```

If you don't specify the `key_files` and `password` options, SSH agent authentication will be attempted. For example:

```ruby
require 'train'
train = Train.create('ssh', host: '1.2.3.4', port: 22, user: 'root')
```

SSH transport has an `ssh_config_file` option to set the SSH config file path. This is set by default to `true` to read the values from the default SSH config file path. For example, `~/.ssh/config`, `/etc/ssh_config`, `/etc/ssh/ssh_config`. Precedence is given to the options set through the arguments.

**WinRM**

```ruby
require 'train'
train = Train.create('winrm',
  host: '1.2.3.4', user: 'Administrator', password: '...', ssl: true, self_signed: true)
```

**Docker**

```ruby
require 'train'
train = Train.create('docker', host: 'container_id...')
```
You can use `user` option to connect with privileged user on non root user images.

```ruby
require 'train'
train = Train.create('docker', host: 'container_id...', user: 'root')
```

For Docker Desktop for Windows, you must enable the "Expose daemon on tcp://localhost:2375 without TLS" setting. To change the URL that train uses to connect to Docker, use the `docker_url` option:

```ruby
require 'train'
train = Train.create('docker', host: 'container_id...', docker_url: 'tcp://localhost:1234')
```

Windows Docker containers require PowerShell, which is assumed to be installed as `powershell.exe`. If it is installed as `pwsh`, use the `--shell-command` option to specify `pwsh` as the shell.

**Podman**

```ruby
require 'train'
train = Train.create('podman', host: 'container_id...')
```

```ruby
require 'train'
train = Train.create('podman', host: 'container_id...', podman_url: 'tcp://localhost:1234')
```

To connect to a Podman container, the Podman API endpoint URL needs to set. It can be set through the `podman_url` option or else Train will check for the CONTAINER_HOST environment variable. If neither is defined then Train will try to connect to the default URL, that is `unix:///run/user/UID/podman/podman.sock` for non-root users and `unix:///run/podman/podman.sock` for the root user. Precedence is given to options set through the arguments.

**AWS**

To use AWS API authentication, setup an AWS client profile to store the Access Key ID and Secret Access Key.

```ruby
require 'train'
train = Train.create('aws', region: 'us-east-2', profile: 'my-profile')
```

You may also use the standard AWS CLI environment variables, `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID`, `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY` and `AWS_REGION`.

```ruby
require 'train'
train = Train.create('aws')
```

**VMware**

```ruby
require 'train'
Train.create('vmware', viserver: '10.0.0.10', user: 'demouser', password: 'securepassword')
```

You may also use environment variables by setting `VISERVER`, `VISERVER__USERNAME`, and `VISERVER_PASSWORD`

```ruby
require 'train'
Train.create('vmware')
```

## Configuration

To get a list of available options for a plugin:

```ruby
puts Train.options('ssh')
```
This will provide all configuration options:

```ruby
{
  :host     => { :required => true},
  :port     => { :default  => 22, :required => true},
  :user     => { :default  => "root", :required => true},
  :keys     => { :default  => nil},
  :password => { :default  => nil},
  ...
```

## Usage

```ruby
# start or reuse a connection
conn = train.connection

# run a command on Linux/Unix/Mac
puts conn.run_command('whoami').stdout

# get OS info
puts conn.os[:family]
puts conn.os[:release]

# access files
puts conn.file('/proc/version').content

# access specific API client functionality
ec2_client = train.connection.aws_client(Aws::EC2::Client)
puts ec2_client.describe_instances

# close the connection
conn.close
```

# Testing

We perform `unit`, `integration` and `windows` tests.

* `unit` tests ensure the intended behaviour of the implementation
* `integration` tests run against VMs and docker containers
* `windows` tests that run on appveyor for windows integration tests

## Mac/Linux

```
bundle exec ruby -W -Ilib:test/unit test/unit/extras/stat_test.rb
```

## Windows

```
# run windows tests
bundle exec rake test:windows

# run single tests
bundle exec ruby -I .\test\windows\ .\test\windows\local_test.rb
```
