## Critical Instructions

### ðŸš¨ File Modification Restrictions
- **DO NOT modify auto-generated files** if present in the repository
- These files should never be manually edited
- Always check for presence of auto-generated files before making changes

### ðŸ”’ Developer Certificate of Origin (DCO) Requirements
- **MANDATORY**: All commits must be signed with DCO using the `-s` flag
- Use `git commit -s` for all commits to add the required "Signed-off-by" line
- DCO ensures legal compliance and contribution authenticity
- Failing to sign commits will cause CI/CD pipeline failures
- If you forget to sign a commit, you can amend it: `git commit --amend -s`

## JIRA Integration & MCP Server Usage

When a JIRA ID is provided:
- Use the `atlassian-mcp-server` MCP server to fetch JIRA issue details
- Read and understand the story requirements thoroughly
- Identify all acceptance criteria and technical requirements
- Implement the task according to the story requirements

## Testing Requirements

- **MANDATORY**: Create comprehensive unit test cases for all implementations
- Ensure test coverage is **> 80%** for the repository
- Use Minitest framework (primary testing framework in this repo)
- Follow existing test patterns in `test/unit/` directories
- Mock external dependencies appropriately

## Testing Standards

### Unit Testing Requirements
- **Framework**: Minitest (primary testing framework)
- **Coverage**: Maintain > 80% test coverage
- **Location**: Tests should be in `test/unit/` directories
- **Naming**: Test files should end with `_test.rb`
- **Mocking**: Use `mocha/minitest` for mocking external dependencies

### Coverage Configuration
```ruby
# Example SimpleCov configuration
SimpleCov.start do
  add_filter "/test/"
  add_group "Transports", ["lib/train/transports"]
  add_group "Platforms", ["lib/train/platforms"]
  add_group "Plugins", ["lib/train/plugins"]
  minimum_coverage 80
end
```

### Test Structure Example
```ruby
require "helper"

describe Train::Transports::MyTransport do
  let(:transport) { Train::Transports::MyTransport.new }
  
  describe "#connection" do
    it "establishes connection successfully" do
      conn = transport.connection
      _(conn).wont_be_nil
    end
    
    it "handles connection errors gracefully" do
      # Mock error conditions
      assert_raises(Train::TransportError) do
        transport.connection(invalid: true)
      end
    end
  end
end
```

## GitHub CLI & PR Creation

When prompted to create a PR:
- Use GitHub CLI to create a branch named after the JIRA ID
- Push changes to the new branch
- Create a PR with proper description using HTML tags
- **MANDATORY**: Add label `runtest:all:stable` to the PR
- All tasks will be performed on local repo

### GitHub CLI Commands
```bash
# Authenticate with GitHub CLI (no ~/.profile needed)
gh auth login

# Create feature branch (use JIRA ID as branch name)
git checkout -b JIRA-12345

# Make your changes, commit them with DCO sign-off
git add .
git commit -s -m "JIRA-12345: Brief description of changes"

# Push branch
git push origin JIRA-12345

# Create PR with proper labeling
gh pr create \
  --title "JIRA-12345: Feature title" \
  --body "<h2>Summary</h2><p>Description of changes...</p><h2>JIRA</h2><p>JIRA-12345</p>" \
  --label "runtest:all:stable"
```

## Prompt-Based Workflow

All tasks should be prompt-based with the following approach:
- After each step, provide a summary of what was completed
- Clearly state what the next step will be
- List remaining steps in the workflow
- Ask for explicit confirmation before proceeding: "Ready to proceed? (y/n)"
- Allow for course correction if needed

## Complete Implementation Workflow

When implementing a task, follow this step-by-step workflow:

### Step 1: JIRA Analysis
- Fetch JIRA details using atlassian-mcp-server
- Analyze requirements and acceptance criteria
- Create implementation plan
- **Prompt**: "Analysis complete. Next step: Implementation. Ready to proceed? (y/n)"

### Step 2: Implementation
- Create/modify necessary files (avoiding prohibited files)
- Follow existing code patterns and conventions
- Ensure proper error handling
- **Prompt**: "Implementation complete. Next step: Unit test creation. Ready to proceed? (y/n)"

### Step 3: Unit Test Creation & Validation
- Create comprehensive test cases for all new code
- Ensure test coverage > 80%
- Run tests to verify they pass: `bundle exec rake test`
- Fix any failing tests or coverage issues
- Verify no existing tests are broken by changes
- **Prompt**: "Tests created and passing. Coverage verified > 80%. Next step: Code quality & linting. Ready to proceed? (y/n)"

### Step 4: Code Quality & Linting
- **MANDATORY**: Run RuboCop linting before creating PR
- Execute `bundle exec rake lint` to check for style and formatting issues
- Run `bundle exec rake lint:auto_correct` to automatically fix correctable violations
- Review and manually fix any remaining RuboCop violations
- Ensure all code passes linting standards and style guidelines
- Verify no new linting violations are introduced
- **Prompt**: "Code quality checks complete. Next step: Documentation. Ready to proceed? (y/n)"

### Step 5: Documentation
- Add appropriate code documentation
- Update README if needed
- Create/update relevant documentation files
- **Prompt**: "Documentation complete. Next step: PR creation. Ready to proceed? (y/n)"

### Step 6: PR Creation
- Create branch using JIRA ID as branch name
- Commit and push changes with DCO sign-off
- Create PR with HTML-formatted description
- Add required label "runtest:all:stable"
- **Prompt**: "PR created successfully. Workflow complete. Any additional steps needed? (y/n)"

## MCP Server Configuration

The repository uses the `atlassian-mcp-server` for JIRA integration:

```json
{
  "servers": {
    "atlassian-mcp-server": {
      "url": "https://mcp.atlassian.com/v1/sse",
      "type": "http"
    }
  }
}
```

## Key Technologies
- **Ruby**: Primary language (Ruby >= 3.1.0)
- **Minitest**: Primary testing framework
- **SimpleCov**: Code coverage tool (enabled only when CI_ENABLE_COVERAGE=1)
- **Bundler**: Ruby dependency management
- **Rake**: Ruby build tool
- **Mocha**: Mocking framework
- **ChefStyle/RuboCop**: Ruby code style enforcement and linting

## Supported Transports
- Local execution
- SSH
- WinRM
- Docker and Podman
- Mock (for testing)
- AWS API
- Azure API
- VMware via PowerCLI
- Habitat

## Best Practices
- Follow existing code patterns in the repository
- Use meaningful variable and method names
- Handle errors gracefully using Train's error classes
- Write clear, concise code with appropriate comments
- Ensure cross-platform compatibility when applicable

## Error Handling

- Always implement proper error handling using Train's error classes
- Use appropriate error types: `Train::TransportError`, `Train::UserError`
- Log errors appropriately for debugging
- Provide meaningful error messages to users
- Handle transport-specific error conditions

## Security Considerations

- Never commit sensitive information (credentials, keys)
- Use environment variables for configuration
- Follow security best practices for transport development
- Validate all inputs appropriately
- Handle authentication securely
- Consider security implications of new transports

## Additional Best Practices

1. **Version Control**
   - Make atomic commits with clear messages
   - Include JIRA ID in commit messages
   - **MANDATORY**: Always use DCO sign-off with `git commit -s`
   - Keep commits focused on single features

2. **Code Reviews**
   - Ensure PR descriptions are comprehensive
   - Include testing information in PR
   - Reference JIRA tickets appropriately
   - Document transport-specific changes

3. **Dependencies**
   - Update Gemfile when adding new Ruby gems
   - Run `bundle install` after dependency changes
   - Ensure all dependencies are properly locked
   - Consider gem compatibility with supported Ruby versions

4. **Performance**
   - Consider performance implications of transport changes
   - Test connection establishment and teardown
   - Optimize for common use cases
   - Profile transport performance when applicable

## Train-Specific Development Guidelines

### Transport Development
- Follow the plugin architecture pattern
- Use Train's connection management
- Implement proper platform detection
- Handle authentication securely
- Support Train's file and command interfaces
- Provide meaningful error messages

### Platform Support
- Consider cross-platform compatibility
- Test on multiple operating systems when applicable
- Use Train's platform detection system
- Handle platform-specific edge cases

### Plugin Development
- Follow Train's plugin registration system
- Provide proper plugin metadata
- Use semantic versioning
- Include comprehensive tests
