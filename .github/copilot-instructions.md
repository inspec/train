# GitHub Copilot Instructions for Train Repository

## TL;DR (Contributor Fast Checklist)
1. bundle install
2. Run tests: bundle exec rake test
3. Lint: bundle exec chefstyle ; bundle exec chefstyle -a ; fix leftovers
4. Add/Update code + unit tests (>80% coverage)
5. Add comprehensive documentation (YARD + README + docs/)
6. Commit with JIRA ID: JIRA-12345: concise summary
7. Create branch (JIRA ID), push, open PR with label runtest:all:stable
8. Respond to review, keep commits atomic

## Change Type â†’ Required Actions Matrix
Change Type | Actions
------------|--------
Small bugfix (logic) | Add failing unit test â†’ fix â†’ lint â†’ PR
New transport | Create lib/train/transports/<name>.rb + tests + YARD docs + README update + docs/<name>_transport.md + usage examples + troubleshooting guide
Enhance existing transport | Update code + targeted tests (success/failure) + adjust platform logic/tests
Plugin (non-transport) utility | Add under lib/train/plugins/... + tests + docs
Dependency bump (runtime) | Update gemspec/Gemfile + run bundle update <gem> + verify compatibility matrix
Security fix | Add regression test, document in PR, consider CHANGELOG entry
Refactor (no behavior change) | Ensure unchanged public API; rely on existing tests + add tests for uncovered branches
Performance improvement | Add micro-benchmark (optional) + ensure no behavior regression
Documentation only | Spellcheck + ensure examples run (if code)

## What NOT To Do
- Do NOT edit generated / vendored content (none presently ending in *.codegen.go, still verify).
- Do NOT add external runtime deps casuallyâ€”prefer stdlib or existing deps; justify additions.
- Do NOT introduce global state without thread-safety review.
- Do NOT change transport option names without deprecation path.
- Do NOT rescue Exception broadlyâ€”target specific Train error classes.
- Do NOT add large binary fixtures (compress/synthesize/mocks instead).

## Repository Overview

This repository contains the Train Transport Interface, a Ruby library that provides a unified interface to talk to local or remote operating systems and APIs. Train is a core component of the Chef InSpec ecosystem.

### Testing Standards

#### Unit Testing Requirements
- **Framework**: Minitest (primary testing framework)
- **Coverage**: Maintain > 80% test coverage
- **Location**: Tests should be in `test/unit/` directories
- **Naming**: Test files should end with `_test.rb`
- **Mocking**: Use `mocha/minitest` for mocking external dependencies

#### Coverage Configuration
```ruby
# Example SimpleCov configuration
SimpleCov.start do
  add_filter "/test/"
  add_group "Transports", ["lib/train/transports"]
  add_group "Platforms", ["lib/train/platforms"]
  add_group "Plugins", ["lib/train/plugins"]
  minimum_coverage 80
end
```

#### Test Structure Example
```ruby
require "helper"

describe Train::Transports::MyTransport do
  let(:transport) { Train::Transports::MyTransport.new }
  
  describe "#connection" do
    it "establishes connection successfully" do
      conn = transport.connection
      _(conn).wont_be_nil
    end
    
    it "handles connection errors gracefully" do
      # Mock error conditions
      assert_raises(Train::TransportError) do
        transport.connection(invalid: true)
      end
    end
  end
end
```
